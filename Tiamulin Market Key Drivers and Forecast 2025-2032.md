The increasing demand for animal health products, especially in the livestock sector, is a key driver of market growth. The rising prevalence of bacterial infections in animals and the need for effective antimicrobial agents are contributing factors that are expected to propel the market during the forecast period. Additionally, the expansion of the global poultry industry and the growing awareness of animal welfare are anticipated to drive the demand for Tiamulin, a commonly used veterinary antibiotic in swine and poultry farming.</p><p>Another significant factor influencing the Tiamulin market is the growing regulatory pressure on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. As governments and regulatory bodies implement stricter guidelines on antibiotic resistance, the demand for targeted, veterinary-approved treatments like Tiamulin is expected to rise. Furthermore, ongoing advancements in veterinary medicine and the development of new formulations are projected to create additional growth opportunities.
